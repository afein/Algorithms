        Variation of the Crossing Bridges problem


Files:

     teleport.c          ; guided BFS solution ~O(2^n)
     teleport-greedy.c   ; greedy matching solution (not optimal O(n^2))
     teleport-dp.c       ; Dynamic Programming solution O(n^2)

     There's also a O(nlogn) solution which includes binary searching
